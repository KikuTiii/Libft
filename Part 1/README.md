**ConteÃºdo:**

-  **ft_isalpha =>** The isalpha() function in C is used to check whether a character is an alphabet or not<hr>
-  **ft_isdigit =>** The isdigit() function is used to check whether the character is a numeric character from 0 to 9 or not.<hr>
-  **ft_isalnum =>** The isalnum() function of C checks if a given character is alphanumeric or not.<hr>
-  **ft_isascii =>** The isascii() function shall test whether c is a 7-bit US-ASCII character code.<hr>
-  **ft_isprint =>** The isprint() function checks whether a character is a printable character or not.<hr>
-  **ft_strlen =>**  The strlen() function in C is used to find the length of a string.<hr>
-  **ft_memset =>**  The memset() function sets the first count bytes of dest to the value c. The value of c is converted to an unsigned character.<hr>
-  **ft_bzero =>** The bzero() function erases the data in the n bytes of the memory
       starting at the location pointed to by s, by writing zeros (bytes
       containing '\0') to that area.<hr>
- **ft_memcpy =>** The memcpy function in C is used to copy data from a memory location to another memory location.<hr>
- **ft_memmove =>** memmove() is used to copy a block of memory from a location to another. It is declared in string.h<hr>
- **ft_strlcpy =>** The strlcpy() function returns the total length of the string that would have been copied if there was unlimited space.<hr>
- **ft_strlcat =>** The strlcat() function returns the total length of the string that would have been created if there was unlimited space.<hr>
- **ft_toupper =>** The toupper() function converts the lowercase letter c to the corresponding uppercase letter.<hr>
- **ft_tolower =>** The tolower() function converts the uppercase letter C to the corresponding lowercase letter.<hr>
- **ft_strrchr =>** The strrchr() function finds the last occurrence of c (converted to a character) in string .<hr>
- **ft_strncmp =>** The strncmp() built-in function compares at most the first count characters of the string pointed to by string1 to the string pointed to by string2.<hr>
- **ft_memchr =>** function memchr() searches for the first occurrence of the character c (an unsigned char) in the first n bytes of the string pointed to, by the argument str.<hr>
- **ft_memcmp =>** The memcmp() function allows the user to make a comparison between the bytes of the two mentioned characters.<hr>
- **ft_strnstr =>** The function strnstr() locates the first occurrence of the null-terminated string \c little in the string \c big, where not more than \c len characters are searched.<hr>
- **ft_atoi =>** The atoi() function converts a character string to an integer value.<hr>
- **ft_calloc =>** The function calloc() allocates the requested memory and returns a pointer to it.<hr>
- **ft_strdup =>** The function strdup() is used to duplicate a string.
